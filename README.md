# BootstrapExample
Example for Capstone 1

<p>This is a basic example to show you how to create your user interface with Bootstrap</p>
<br>
<h3>Important Things to Remember</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When creating your new ASP.NET Visual Studio Solution, be sure to <strong>uncheck "Create directory for your solution."</strong> This will help you for Capstone 2</li>
	<li>Use <strong>ASP.NET controls</strong>, not HTML inputs (unless it's strictly something client-side ex. Modal)</li>
	<li>Make sure you add the references in your ASP pages for the Bootstrap CSS and JS. You can add the files to your project or use a CDN</li>
	<li>Boostrap needs jQuery to run, make sure you reference it before your Boostrap JS reference</li>
	<li>Reference your external style sheets <strong>after</strong> the Bootstrap CSS reference</li>
	<li>Placing your JS reference before the ending body tag usually helps the page load faster</li>
	<li>Be sure to add <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" gt;</code> to your head so your page is mobile first
</ul>
